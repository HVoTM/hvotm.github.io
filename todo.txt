===========================================
The basic format for a `todo.txt` file is simple and minimalistic. Each line represents a single task, and specific conventions are used to add details. Here's the format:

---

### Basic Task Format
```
[x] (A) 2024-12-21 Task description +Project @Context
```

---

### Explanation of the Components:
1. **`[x]`**: Marks the task as completed.
   - Example: `[x] Call Alice`

2. **`(A)`**: Priority indicator.
   - Priorities are single letters `(A)` to `(Z)`, with `(A)` being the highest.
   - Example: `(B) Submit assignment`

3. **`2024-12-21`**: Date the task was created or due.
   - Optional but useful for tracking deadlines.
   - Example: `2024-12-21 Renew car insurance`

4. **`Task description`**: A short description of the task.
   - Example: `Fix the kitchen sink`

5. **`+Project`**: Project tag, indicating the task belongs to a specific project.
   - Example: `Write report +Work`

6. **`@Context`**: Context tag, used to specify where or how the task should be done.
   - Example: `Buy groceries @Errands`

---

### Examples:
1. A task with priority, project, and context:
   ```
   (A) 2024-12-21 Finish the presentation +Work @Office
   ```

2. A simple completed task:
   ```
   [x] 2024-12-20 Watch tutorial video
   ```

3. Tasks without priority or tags:
   ```
   Clean the house
   ```

---

### Tips for Usage:
- **Keep it simple**: Use only the fields you need. You can always add more details later.
- **Sort by priority**: Organize tasks to focus on `(A)` items first.
- **Sync across devices**: Use tools like `Todo.txt CLI`, mobile apps, or text editors for easy management.
